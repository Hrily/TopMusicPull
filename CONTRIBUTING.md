## Issues and labels

Our bug tracker utilizes several labels  to help organize and identify issues.
Here's what they represent and how we use them:

- `bug` is used for marking verified bugs.
- `duplicate` is used to marked duplicated issue reports.
- `High Priority` is used to mark things that needs to be done ASAP.
- `In progress` is used for issues where the developers work on.
- `invalid` is used for incorrect reports?
- `question` is used for reports where developers ask things to each other.
- `wontfix` is used for things that doesn't fix at the moment. But later in the dev process.

For a complete look at our labels, see the project labels page

## Bug reports

A bug is a *demonstrable problem* that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Validate and lint your code** - to ensure that the bug is in your own code or not.
2. **Use the github issue search** - check if the issue is already reported.
3. **Check if the issue has been fixed** - try to reproduce it using the lastest `master` or `development` branch in the repo.
4. **isolate the problem** - So the developing doesn't have hard times finding the possible bug.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information.
Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.
What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue?
What browser(s) and OS experience the problem?
Do other browsers show the bug differently?
What would you expect to be the outcome?
All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the [coding guidelines](#code-guidelines) used throughout the
project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements
(such as test coverage).
